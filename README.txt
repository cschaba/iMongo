DESCRIPTION

This is a little Frontend to browse through the contents of a single MongoDB using mobile Devices.

The Frontend uses jquerymobile, so it should run on iPhone, iPad or other Android mobile devices.  It can browser through all databases on one configured host. (see config.php) .  At the moment it is a brower, means all data is readonly.
